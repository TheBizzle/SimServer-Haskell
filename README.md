SimServer-Haskell
===============

An experimental reimplementation my SimServer project in Haskell.  SimServer is a system for allowing easy distribution of NetLogo and interaction with it via the web.  See [the original implementation](https://github.com/NetLogo/SimServer) for more details.

For the time being, this project is abandoned.  I only scratched the surface on porting things over, but, as I was trudging through the barren wasteland of the SimServer source, I realized just how agonizing the idea of reimplementing all of that nonsense felt to me, so I decided to move to something that better captivated my interest.
